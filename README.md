Finding sine equations for climate phenomena.

## Abstract

The global climate is a chaotic and complex system. The climate system constantly changes
due to internal variability and natural external perturbation. The earth’s axial rotation causes daily
changes in temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, humidity and other climate variables. Over
short time scales (ranging from minutes to several days) movement of clouds, air masses, and
fronts contribute to rapid, often unpredictable, changes in weather. The earth’s annual rotation
about the sun causes large seasonal changes in climate. Multi-annual to decade mode transitions
such as the El Nino and La Nina cycles in the Pacific cause additional variability in the climate
system. Therefore, determining the global effects of ENSO occurrences is considered one of the
important issues.

In this thesis, applications of Machine Learning and Evolutionary Algorithms on the global cli-
mate are presented. El Nino and La Nina events are classified according to Oceanic Nino Index val-
ues using Machine Learning classification methods and are also classified according to their shapes

by eye and automatically by ML clustering methods. The equations are found for events using EAs
where Genetic Programming is used to find average equations for groups and Real Valued Genetic
Algorithm is used to find equation of each event with changing parameters of average equation.
These algorithms are worked on island model in GPU programming to reduce time computation.
Using equations, geophysicists and meteorologists can better understand climatic phenomena and
make new analysis on these phenomena.
